<h5>61. I love seeing old Israeli men sitting at a table, laughing, playing shesh-besh, eating nuts and smoking- knowing that they have probably been friends for years and been through a lot together.</h5>

<h5>62. I love seeing a group of guys my age, that are so close and are like brothers.. knowing that in 40 years time they will be what I described above.</h5>

<h5>64. (Only those who have experienced this feeling will be able to understand it) I love that feeling you get when you just realize. You just have a moment of realization of how lucky it is to be here. Be it on a memorial day, or at the top of a mountain during a hike with friends, or on a packed bus. There are those moments where you all of a sudden appreciate where you are. In the state of Israel. The Jewish homeland. Those moments, are truly great.</h5>

<h5>17. I love that last year during the Memorial ceremony for the fallen soldiers of Israel, I met a Holocaust survivor who spent the evening telling me his story and held my hand during the Hatikva.</h5>
